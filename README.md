#Background Subtraction and Replacement with Google DeepLabv3+

<!-- MAIN -->
Description:</br>
This project is a combination of two modules:
+ Segmentation module: we included four pretrained Google DeepLabv3+ models for users to choose from, these models have the ability to segment twenty kinds of objects apart from background.
+ Changing background module: this part allows user to choose a new image as a background and apply one segmented object to that background.

Main Reference Paper and Source Code:
+ L.-C. Chen, Y. Zhu, G. Papandreou, F. Schroff, and H. Adam, ''Encoder-decoder with atrous separable convolution for semantic image segmentation,'' in ECCV, 2018.
